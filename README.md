All models performed well and the scores were within the acceptable ranges of accuracy. However, the linear regression model had better results. The xgboost model underperformed in comparison to the linear regression model. 
One interesting aspect that was shown with our tableau graphs was that students in public or private school still had lower performance scores if they qualified for school lunch.  
If we were to conduct this study again in the future some other information would be resourceful would be things such as:
-Median Household Income
-Transportation Access
-Demographics/Diversity of the Faculty 
-Type of Lunch.
